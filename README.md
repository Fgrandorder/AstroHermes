Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

The landing page uses a Splash template that can be edited in `node_modules/starlight/components/Hero.astro`.

Similarly, you can edit Astro's built-in components in `node_modules/starlight/user_components` and go to the respective component found.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
